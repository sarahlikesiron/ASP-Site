        <h2>Grading</h2>
        <p>I feel that my website follows the CRAP design techniques, there is a unified, clean design among all pages, and I think that the colors match and contrast pretty well.  The text and imags that I have included on the pages flow well and are organized in a logical way, allowing people to see information on each page that they would want to and expect to see there.  I feel like my use of a timeline on the history page makes it more interesting, with the inclusion of some javascript to make the dropdown in the one section functional.  I used both HTML5 and CSS3 on my site, not relying on some of the older features, instead using the newer ones.  I have included a references page, linking the sites I used to find the information, besides the infomation I already knew about the park.  All of the images are my own.</p><br><br>
        
        <h2>Final Grading Additions</h2>
        <h3>Comments form</h3>
        <p>The comments form is located on its own page, titled comments in the navbar (or comments.php) and allows users to leave their name and their comment about my site on the page.  It works as specified, validating that the user enters data in all fields and sanitizes the strings before inserting them into a table.</p><br>
        <h3>Original javascrip component</h3>
        <p>The original javascript component that I included in my site is the image gallery/slideshow that is located on the home page.  It allows for a user to switch between what image is displaying in the background, by using the arrows located on the images.</p><br>
        <h3>DHTML Component</h3>
        <p>The dhtml component is located on the history page, in the div with the information about the 1920's park history in it.  The arrow located at the bottom expands and shows more information when the user clicks on it.  When the user clicks the arrow, the style.visibility of the items inside the hidden part of the div is changed from none to block so that they can be seen, or from block to none to hide them again.</p><br>
        <h3>Extras</h3>
        <p>The majority of the extras for my site have pretty much stayed the same from the first iteration, with my design being considered as an extra (good crap principles).  I think that my media queries work pretty well, although they could be edited more to make the text easier to read when the window is resided.  I think that the history page is still really interesting and a cool extra to my site, as it is not something that is always included on sites and mine looks good and works well.</p><br>
        <h3>Parts I Fixed</h3>
        <p>From the grading on the midterm version of this site, I changed everything that had points taken off before.  Each page now shows the user where they are (in the nav bar) by changing the text color to a blue.  My menu goes to a hamburger menu for mobile devices and is reactive to changes.  I made the text larger, so it easier to read (although it might be too large for mobile devices now).  The title deals with smaller viewports better now, with some small issues but nothing like before at all.  Overall I made all of the suggested improvements for this final version.</p><br>
