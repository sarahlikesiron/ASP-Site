        <h2>Red House Lake and Dam</h2><br>
        <p>Red House lake is the only lake located on the Red House side of the park and was created along with the creation of the dam in the parks early years.  The lake features a couple small islands, which if desired, can be landed on and explored (although they are all very overgrown now).  There is a swimming area and beach, including a playground and ice cream stand.  The boat house located next to the beach rents out kayaks and paddle boats, as well as bikes.</p>
        
        <h3>Bike Path</h3><br>
        <p>Winding around the lake is a 5.6 mile paved bike path, allowing people to experience all angles of the lake, as well as other areas near the lake.  The loop around the lake itself is only around 3 miles and the bike path route is not overly difficult, with some marked steep spots, but overall pretty easy.</p>
        
        <h3>Wetland Observation Area</h3><br>
        <p>The wetland observation area is a newer part of the park, located near the bottom of the dam.  The area features a series of boardwalks and an observation area, winding through a small portion of the wetland area found within the park.  The possibility of seeing different animals there is definitely pretty high.</p><br>

        <h2>Administration Building</h2><br>
        <p>The Administration building located in Red House is arguably one of the most architectually interesting buildings found within the park.  Featuring a gift shop, natural history museum, the rental office, the park restaurant, and park safety, this 1920's Tudor-style building has been central to the park's identity since it was built.  Recently, there has been a lot of restoration happening to the building to try and preserve its unique features.</p>
        
        <h3>Former Zoo</h3><br>
        <p>Located up the stairs behind the Admin building is the remnats of the former zoo of Allegany State Park.  Built by the CCC, this zoo housed a bear den, a "snake pit", and an outdoor pavillion which contained tanks and cages for vaious animals. The remnants of the bear den, snake pit, and pavillion can be seen today.</p>
        
        <h3>Former Ski Jumps</h3><br>
        <p>At one point Allegany offered ski jumping at their two main ski jumps, located in the woods behind the administration building.  The jumps were some of the first in Western New York, made of all natural materials, and were rated some of the best in the country at the time.  The ski jumps were constructed by the CCC, as many of the features in the park were, and today the remnants can be seen on the Red Jacket hiking trail.</p>

        <h2>Thunder Rocks</h2><br>
        <p>Thunder Rocks is composed of giant rocks that can be looked at, walked up to, and climbed (although not advised), it is one of the only naturally occuring attractions within the park.  The rocks are located at the top of a mountain, which is connected to the main road by a seasonal rock road.  The rocks can be assumed to be one of the more popular places within the park, probably because of their size.</p>
