        <h2>Quaker Lake</h2>
        <p>Quaker Lake is a man-made lake created by the building of the Quaker Dam in the mid 1960's.  The Lake features a beach and swimming area, where kayaks and paddle boards can be rented, as well as place to put kayaks and similar boats in.  The beach on the Quaker Side is generally regarded to be nicer than the one on the Red House side, so it is recommended to visit.  Fishing is allowed around almost the whole lake, as well as on the fishing dock near the boat put in.</p>

        <h2>Science Lake</h2>
        <p>Science Lake was the first lake created in Allegany, also marking the first area that swimming was allowed in the park.  While swimming is no longer allowed, the lake is still a great place to visit.  A trail around the lake was recently added, allowing people to walk around it and see what was once there.</p>
        
        <h2>Ampitheater</h2>
        <p>The ampitheater not only has a neat architectural design, it allows houses fun events for the whole family each week during the summer.  The Hootenanny is a family sing-along event that is unique to the ampitheater, and is something that must be experienced.  Overall, the Quaker ampitheater is a place to be seen, even experienced, if possible.</p>

        <h2>Quaker Store</h2>
        <p>The Quaker Store is the one-stop place on the Quaker side to be able to get anything you could need while camping, or to just get Wifi since most of the park does not have any service.  The store also features a small gift shop, a fudge place, and an ice cream stand as well, making it a place to see.</p>
        
        <h2>Quaker Museum</h2>
        <p>The Quaker museum is arguably one of the most interesting places in the park, depicting the history of the park, most of which cannot be found anywhere else.  The building also features a gift shop and a laundromat, although the hours of all are weird so make sure to catch them when you can.</p>
