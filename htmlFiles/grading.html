        <h2>Grading</h2>
        <p>I feel that my website follows the CRAP design techniques, there is a unified, clean design among all pages, and I think that the colors match and contrast pretty well.  The text and imags that I have included on the pages flow well and are organized in a logical way, allowing people to see information on each page that they would want to and expect to see there.  I feel like my use of a timeline on the history page makes it more interesting, with the inclusion of some javascript to make the dropdown in the one section functional.  I used both HTML5 and CSS3 on my site, not relying on some of the older features, instead using the newer ones.  I have included a references page, linking the sites I used to find the information, besides the infomation I already knew about the park.  All of the images are my own.</p>
