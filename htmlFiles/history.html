                <h2>The 1920s</h2><br>
                <p>The movement for the park launched and was supported, leading to its establishment in 1921</p>
                <h4>Park officially dedicated on July 30, 1921</h4>

                    <h4>1921</h4>
                    <p>Through Chapter 468 of the Laws of 1921, 67,000 acres of land were acquired to form the park, fulfilling the need for a large forest recreational area in Western New York.  The same Chapter also created a commission to oversee land acquisition and the beginning of the development of the park.  This commission was headed by Albert Fancher and they worked to build roads, trails, and bridges and provide and operate the first facilities.</p>
                    <h4>1924</h4>
                    <p>The first bond for the park was issued, giving funds to continue developing facilities for the park.  The first administration building was created from an old schoolhouse and surplus WWI tents were placed on wooden platforms for people to use to camp.</p>
                    <h4>1926</h4>
                    <p>The dam at Science Lake was built and finished, creating Science Lake and the first swimming area in the park.  All of the lakes in Allegany State Park are man-made, there are no naturally occuring ones.  The Allegany School of Natural History was also established around Science Lake, creating a place for people to learn about and experience nature.  The Summit Fire Tower, in the now Art Roscoe area, was built, as well as 2 other towers in other areas of the park.  The Summit Fire Tower is no longer in use now, but it still stands and can be visited.</p>
                    <h4>1927</h4>
                    <p>The Red House area began to be developed during this time period.  The tudor-style administration building, which is still in use today, was built.</p>
                    <h4>1929</h4>
                    <p>Red House dam was built, forming Red House Lake, the first major lake in the Red House area.</p>

                <h2>The 1930's and 1940's</h2><br>
                <p>The park was extensively developed during the Great Depression and New Deal Era, through both the Civilian Conservation Corps and the Works Progress Administration.  The CCC built roads, bridges, camping areas, trails, and picnic areas.  Conservation projects were also established, including reforestation, stream bank retention, and wildlife improvements.  The CCC is regonized to have built the Stone Observation Tower, the stone pillars at the entrace to the Red House area, the BeeHunter hiking trail, the Ryan trail and the cabins along it, a school house, and a toboggan slide.  While most of the structures still stand today, some do not and others have been completely renovated.</p>
