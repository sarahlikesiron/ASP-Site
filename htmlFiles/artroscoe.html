        <h2>Trails</h2>
        <p>The trails in the Art Roscoe area can be used for hiking, mountain biking, or cross-country skiing, depending on the season.  They are a series of connected and intersecting trails that weave through the woods on the Red House side of the park.  The original 6 trails are part of the Allegany 18 challenge, but 3 more have been added.</p>
        
        <h3>Summit Fire Tower</h3>
        <p>The Summit Fire Tower is located in the Art Roscoe trail woods areas, standing at 60 feet tall.  The tower was abandoned in the 70's and is closed to the public now, although there are guided tours that occur on certain weekends where you can climb up it.  Although the tower is not much now, it is still really cool to see.</p>
