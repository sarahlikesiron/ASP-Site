            <h2>Why Stay?</h2><br>
            <p>Staying in the park offers a range of benefits, allowing multiple days to experience everything that the park has to offer.  In addition, camping anywhere is always fun, especially with people you know.</p>

            <h2>Camp Sites</h2><br>
            <p>While cabin trails can be found throughout the park, there are only a couple main areas with camp sites.  On the Quaker side, there is the Cain Hollow campground, offering around 164 campsites.  The Diehl Tent and Trailer Trail has recently been opened on ASP route 1, offering 22 sites, without electricity.  On the Red House side, the Red House Tent and Trailer Area allows for both tent and trailer camping, offering 5 separate loops with sites.  Camping sites on both sides offer both electric or primitive sites depending on what is desired.</p>

        <div class="camp2">
            <h2>Cabins</h2><br>
            <p>Allegany State Park offers over 20 different cabin trails, with cabin types ranging from the original one-room "Quaker" style, to the full-service cottages and cabins featuring multiple rooms.  The Quaker side has over 230 cabins for rent, with 30 of them winterized.  The Red House side has over 144 cabins available, with 128 of them winterized.  For winter rentals, typically most of the Quaker side is shut down and not maintained, since there is not as much offered there.  Please note that there are still cabins on both sides of the park that do not have electricity or inlcude a refigerator, so be sure to check before booking.  The Summit Cabin Trail is up near the Art Roscoe ski area, allowing for skiers and other winter sports enjoyers to enjoy the area.</p>

            <h2>Group Camps</h2><br>
            <p>Allegany currently has 2 group camps open for the public to use, out of the original 12.  Group Camp 5 is located on the Quaker side of the park, featuring a recently redone bathroom and shower house and cabins.  The Quaker side also houses Camp Turner, a private summer camp for people, that is also rented out during the winter.  The Red House side features Camp 12, with recently redone cabins, and Camp 10, although it is currently not open.  Camp 10 has a redone shower and bath house and amazing mess hall, although all of the cabins have been torn down.  The future of it is unknown.  Camp Allegany, though not operated by Allegany, is also considered a group camp.</p><br>
            <p>Renting a group camp is an excellent choice for large groups who want to all stay in one place.  Each camp has an assortment of cabins, a centralized mess hall, and bathroom and shower complexes.</p><br>
            <p>Staying with a large group at a group camp offers so many benefits.  Group camps allow everyone to eat together in a mess hall, designed to allow families or people to rotate who cooks when, or everyone cooks on their own.  At night, everyone can gather around the fire, spending time together that cannot be exchanged for anything else.</p>
